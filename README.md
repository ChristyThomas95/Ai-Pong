# Pong game using AI

This is the upgraded version of the pong game. instead of playing alone or each other with friends, 
i have added an Ai called "Timmy" into the game. This program is created with the NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies.
Keep in mind you may have to run and teach timmy the game play before playing aganist him. 
In addition you may have to install pygame and neat into your IDE if its not installed.
